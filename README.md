A curated portfolio of graduate-level work in economic forecasting, machine learning, and policy modeling using real-world data.

##  Projects

- [Forecasting Protest Onset in the Western Balkans](./Forecasting_Protest): Built an early-warning model using Google Trends and macroeconomic indicators. Applied panel logistic regression and rolling cross-validation to assess onset prediction across six countries.

- [The Effect of the TseTse Fly on African Development](./TseTse_Fly_Econometrics): Replication of Alsan (2015) using Python to explore how the historical presence of the TseTse fly impacted political centralization and long-run economic development in Africa.

- [SPXSignal: Machine Learning Forecasting Toolkit](./SPXSignal_ML_Toolkit): A comprehensive S&P 500 forecasting project using Neural Networks, LSTM, Gaussian Process Regression, and ARMA+GARCH. Includes volatility modeling, Granger causality networks, and sensitivity analysis across price, returns, and direction.
  
- [S&P 500 Time Series Forecasting](./S&P500_Forecast): Compared traditional time series (ARIMA) and machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict daily stock market returns.

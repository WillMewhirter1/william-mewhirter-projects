# S&P 500 Time Series Forecasting

This project builds and evaluates several models to forecast S&P 500 stock returns using historical data. It explores both traditional time series methods and machine learning approaches to compare predictive performance.

##  Objective
To forecast future movements in the S&P 500 index using past return data, and evaluate how machine learning models compare with classical econometric approaches.

##  Methods & Tools
- **Data**: Historical S&P 500 closing prices and returns (daily)
- **Tools**: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, statsmodels)
- **Models**:
  - ARIMA
  - Linear regression (with lagged features)
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Machines

##  Evaluation
- Train-test split with walk-forward validation
- Forecast accuracy measured using MSE and directional accuracy

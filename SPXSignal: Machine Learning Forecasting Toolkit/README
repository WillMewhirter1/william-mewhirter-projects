# SPXSignal: Machine Learning Forecasting Toolkit

**SPXSignal** applies a range of machine learning and econometric models to forecast the S&P 500 index’s price, log returns, and directional movement. It integrates causality analysis, volatility modeling, and model comparison to understand short-term predictability in financial markets.

##  Objective

To evaluate and compare how various models—including Neural Networks, LSTM, Gaussian Processes, and ARMA+GARCH—perform in forecasting different aspects of the S&P 500. The project also investigates volatility spillovers and return causality across global equity markets using Granger networks.

##  Methods & Tools

###  Part 1: Volatility & Causality Analysis
- EWMA volatility estimation vs. 10-week rolling standard deviation
- Granger causality networks for weekly/monthly returns and volatilities
- Feature selection using Granger tests, OLS, and Random Forests
- Markets analyzed: US (S&P500), UK (FTSE), Germany (GDAXI), Japan (N225), India (BSESN), Mexico (MXX), Indonesia (JKSE)

###  Part 2: Forecasting Models
- Neural Networks (multi-layer, tested across activations/layers)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gaussian Process Regression (stationary vs. non-stationary kernels)
- ARMA + GARCH (benchmark econometric models)

##  Evaluation Metrics
- **Price & Return**: Normalized RMSE (NRMSE)
- **Direction**: Accuracy
- Sensitivity analysis: 1% shocks to explanatory variables

##  Key Findings
- Neural Networks had the best performance in forecasting price and returns
- LSTM outperformed others on direction prediction, though all models favored the positive class
- Gaussian Processes were stable but underfit some targets
- Volatility and return causality networks confirmed the central role of U.S. markets and the VIX as global risk drivers

# The Effect of the TseTse Fly on African Development

This project replicates the core analysis from Alsan (2015), which explores how the historical presence of the TseTse fly — a vector for African trypanosomiasis — influenced precolonial societal development and continues to impact long-run economic outcomes across Africa.

##  Objective
To reproduce the main regression results from the original paper and examine how disease ecology shaped institutional development and economic performance across African regions.

##  Methods & Tools
- **Data**: Publicly available replication dataset from Alsan (2015)
- **Tools**: Python (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib)
- **Analysis**: OLS regression models, scatterplots, robustness checks

##  Key Findings
- Reproduced the negative relationship between TseTse fly suitability and historical political centralization
- Confirmed the paper’s conclusion that ecological constraints contributed to institutional underdevelopment
- Gained experience in historical econometrics and academic replication practices

##  Files
- `TseTseFly_DevelopmentImpact.ipynb`: Full notebook with data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations
